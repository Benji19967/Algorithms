## Implementation

Backtracking involves recursion. 

## Problems

Backtracking is often used when there is a large solution tree. 

### N-Queens

The classic problem requiring backtracking is the N-Queens problem: The goal is to 
place n queens on an nxn board such that no two Queens attack each other (see chess 
rules)
